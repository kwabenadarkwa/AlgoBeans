# Grokking Algorithms and Data Structures
This is my attempt at deeply understanding the core data structures and algorithms. 
It has implementations of some of the popular algorithms(bfs, dfs, sorting algorithms etc) and data structures(trees, linked lists, queues etc.) 

I'm attempting to solve all the problems in the `Cracking the Coding Interview` book and go cover to cover with it.
